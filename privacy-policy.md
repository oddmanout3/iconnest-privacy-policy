Privacy Policy for IconNest
Last updated: September 15, 2025

Thank you for using IconNest, an application developed by Preston Donovan. Your privacy is very important to us. This policy explains what information IconNest accesses and how that information is handled.

Our core privacy principle is simple: IconNest is designed to work entirely on your device. We do not collect, store, or transmit your personal data to our servers.

Information We Collect and How We Use It
To provide its core functionality, IconNest needs to access specific information on your device.

List of Installed Applications:

What we access: IconNest scans the list of applications installed on your device.

Why we access it: This is necessary to display your apps within IconNest so you can select them to create your custom home screen widgets.

How it's handled: This list is processed only on your device. The list of your apps is never sent to our servers, and we do not track which apps you use or have installed.

Widget Configuration Data:

What we collect: This includes the layouts, grid configurations, sizing, and color choices you make when creating a widget.

How it's handled: All widget configuration data is stored locally in the app's private storage on your device. We do not have access to your created layouts.

Permissions Requested
Notifications (POST_NOTIFICATIONS):

IconNest may request permission to send notifications. This permission is used to provide important status updates, such as indicating when the widget "Edit Mode" is active. You can manage notification permissions at any time in your device's system settings.

Run at Startup (RECEIVE_BOOT_COMPLETED):

IconNest receives a notification when your device finishes booting up. This is necessary to ensure that your widgets are properly initialized and displayed correctly on your home screen after a restart. No personal information is collected or stored during this process.

In-App Purchases
IconNest may offer a premium version available for purchase.

All in-app purchases are processed securely by the Google Play Store.

We do not collect or have access to your payment information, such as credit card numbers or billing addresses.

For more information on how Google handles your data during a purchase, please refer to Google's Privacy Policy.

Data Backup and Restore
IconNest utilizes Android's Auto Backup service to back up your app data, such as your widget configurations, to your personal Google Drive account. This helps you restore your setups when you reinstall the app or switch to a new device. We, the developers of IconNest, do not have access to this backup data as it is stored securely in your private Google Drive.

Information Sharing and Disclosure
We do not sell, trade, or share any of your personal information or app data with third parties. All data required for the app to function remains on your device.

Analytics and Logging
We do not use any third-party analytics or logging services. We do not track your usage of the app or collect any crash reports.

Children's Privacy
We are committed to protecting the privacy of children who may use our app. This app is intended for a general audience but may be used by children.

IconNest does not knowingly collect any personally identifiable information from children under the age of 13. The core functionality of the app, including accessing the list of installed applications and saving widget configurations, is performed locally on the user's device. This data is not transmitted, stored, or viewed by us and is never shared with third parties.

Parents and guardians are encouraged to monitor their children's online usage. If you believe that your child has provided any form of personal information through our app, please contact us immediately at [Your Support Email Address] so we can take necessary actions.

Changes to This Privacy Policy
We may update our Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on this page. You are advised to review this Privacy Policy periodically for any changes.
